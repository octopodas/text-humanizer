## Chunking rules
- Each chunk must be between 300 and 500 characters (count carefully)
- Favor longer chunks — aim as close to 500 characters as possible without exceeding it
- Merge shorter ideas together into one chunk if they fit within the 500-char limit
- Split at natural semantic boundaries: paragraph breaks, topic shifts, argument steps
- Do NOT split mid-sentence or mid-idea
- Each chunk must read as a standalone unit
- Preserve all content — don't drop anything
- Use the minimum number of chunks needed while respecting the limits
